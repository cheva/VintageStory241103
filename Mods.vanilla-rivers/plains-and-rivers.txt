NOT WORKS!!! 
Settings "vanilla plains and rivers 256k 320h 80% 300% 0% 100% &200% rare minerals" 
Maybe 80%300 are too much or 0%100 must be 30%200 ???
NOT WORKS!!! 
50% 200% too

Wow, this creates absolutely stunning worlds. Been tinkering around with worldgen settings for a few hours to see what I liked.

For reference in case anyone else finds themselves liking these settings, I found myself really enjoying a combination 
of Plains and Valleys together with the Rivers mod ( https://mods.vintagestory.at/rivers ) using the following settings:

World Height: 320
Landcover: 90% (80 if you want a bit more water)
Landcover scale: 400%
Upheaval: 0%
Landform scale: 100% (if you want a bit more flatness to the terrain, go higher up to 150%. However I felt it became 'too' flat)

For the Rivers mod I changed it's modconfig (%AppData%\VintagestoryData\ModConfig/Rivers.json) "oceanThreshold" setting from 30 to 15.
